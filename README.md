# jQuery Tabs
## Things to do:

1. <del>Remove `defaults = {tabs:"a"}` - it didn't really do anything - maybe not, i don't know</del> Obviously you need that.
2. <del>Check for `mailto` links</del> - not really needed, just don't use it like that. That's not what it is for.
3. Add animation options
4. Do I need to use the `$.proxy()`?
